BEHAVE application
======
The **BEHAVE application** is a tool which will help you to gather data and make it easier to evaluate the effect size created by the different behavioural interventions you introduce. The BEHAVE application supports the **management** of selected **problem behaviours** through the creation of custom measures using the operational definition of a particular behaviour, the collection of behavioural data and the comparison between the baseline scores and the intervention conditions. The application provides users with accurate features to interpret the results collected and present them with a visual comparison of data represented through **scatter plots** and with **statistical analyses**. In particular, the application can automatically identify the best effect size algorithm between those developed by Parker and al (2011) and Allison and Gorman (1993) and returns the effect size through a simplified visual speedometer which is helpful for "non-experts". A vital aim of this application is the introduction of a scientific evidence-based approach of data collection and analysis and bringing it into the educational setting. The BEHAVE application is designed for teachers and health professionals who want to accurately assess the efficacy of their actions and strategies.      
The BEHAVE application is based on a client-server architecture. The clients (web browsers) are connected to the Apache/httpd application server running the PHP framework Symfony on top of a MySQL and a CouchDb databases. The client frontend has been developed using the Bootstrap framework that make it easier to develop responsive application adaptable to any screen size. The module RApache (Horner, 2012) is installed on the Apache web server to analyse the datasets collected by the users.   
The BEHAVE application is one of the main results of the **BEHAVE project** (http://www.behaveproject.eu) funded in the framework of an ERASMUS+ KA2 Strategic Partnership for school education project (2017-1-IT02-KA201-036540).
